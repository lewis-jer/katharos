# Introduction

## Summary
Katharos is a modern JavaScript framework for building enterprise user interfaces with a focus on scalability and simplicity. It provides a modular architecture that can be easily scaled between an integration and a full framework depending on business needs.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Built with a plugin-based system allowing easy extension
- **Enterprise Ready**: Designed specifically for building complex enterprise applications
- **ES5 Compatible**: Supports all ES5-compliant browsers (IE11 and below are not supported)
- **Lightweight Core**: The core library focuses on model and view layers with minimal overhead
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Supporting libraries like katharos-router for complete application development

## Architecture Overview

Katharos follows a component-based architecture with these main concepts:

### Core Components

1. **Interface**: The main entry point that manages the framework lifecycle
2. **System**: Handles internal state management and module registration
3. **Plugins**: Extensible modules that add functionality to the framework
4. **Store**: Centralized state management for application data
5. **User**: User management and authentication utilities

## Installation

```bash
npm install katharos
```

## Quick Example

```javascript
import Interface from 'katharos';

// Create a new katharos instance
const app = new Interface();

// Configure the application
app.configure({
  initialize: true,
  // Additional configuration options
});

// Register a plugin
await app.register({
  name: 'my-plugin',
  handler: async (context) => {
    // Plugin logic here
  }
});

// Create and initialize the application
await app.create();
```
