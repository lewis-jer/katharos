## Introduction

Katharos is a **framework** for building enterprise user interfaces. The package can be easily scaled between an integration and a framework depending on business needs. The core library focuses on the model and view layers, with an ecosystem of supporting libraries to ensure complexity is no barrier when developing enterprise applications.

#### Browser Compatibility

Katharos supports all [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) browsers (IE11 and below are not supported).
